#Wings Ordering Service

This repo contains a simple Rails app I created while I was a student at Launch Academy in Boston. I built it mainly to practice using Rails form helpers to collect user input. The assigment was to create an application that accepts wing orders of various flavors, and saves them to a PSQL database.

The app is fully tested with RSpec/Capybara. See test files in the `spec` folder.
